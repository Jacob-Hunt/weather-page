# Weather Page
A responsive web page for showing the local weather.  Uses different background images based on current weather.  Will probably be expanded into a full home page with local news, search bar, links, etc.

Page designed and built by Jacob Hunt.

Built using Bootstrap, jQuery, the freeCodeCamp mirror of OpenWeatherMap API, and the OwFont Weather Icons by Deniz Fuchidzhiev.

# TODO
* Fix loader positioning for small screen sizes
* Refactor loader html/css into separate files
* Improve code for noWeatherError()
* Add different backgrounds for day/night
